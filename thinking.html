        Some of my unstructured thoughts. Not really questions or answers. Not
        refined enough to be blog posts. Just a lot of my open-ended ruminations
        and rants into the void.

      <p><b>Social Darwinism</b></p>
      <p>
        I recently watched the <i>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</i> movie,
        and one element of the plot that stuck out was the primates insisting on
        "evolving" their society through the aid of human technology. The movie
        seems to have this embedded critique of agential theories of evolution -
        that natural selection is a process propelled by conscious decisions
        rather than inarticulable environmental pressures. Along this path, the
        movie appears to also architect a critique of intellect as the primary
        bottleneck for civilizational advancement; the apes are clearly
        underdeveloped as ethical agents, but they have surpassed in cognitive
        ability the average human. There is more to be said along these two
        ideas as critiques of social darwinism.

      <p><b>Willpower / Ego Depletion</b></p>
      <p>
        Ever since I was in high school, I thought that willpower was a finite
        commodity. You had to budget the quantity of difficult tasks that you
        were to complete throughout the day, otherwise you'd just run out of
        "will". At the time, I was compelled by
        <a
          href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Baumeister%20et%20al.%20(1998).pdf"
          >a study</a
        >
        that had subjects eat tasy / distasteful food before a difficult task
        and measured the likelihood of them completing that task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, looking back, it seems like the minimal test case of having
        participants eat different foods before challenging tasks was too
        limited to generalize well to all domains involving "willpower".
        Additionally, there appear that this particular study has some
        <a
          href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147770"
          >replicability problems</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears that willpower-oriented explanations of human behavior are
        just observations of a placebo effect -- the more likely someone thinks
        that willpower is limited,
        <a
          href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/have-we-been-thinking-about-willpower-the-wrong-way-for-30-years"
          >you're more likely to feel less willpower.</a
        >
        I'd be fascinated to see whether people would live different lives if
        this belief were reversed.

      <p><b>Probability</b></p>
      <p>
        Probability is not
        <a href="https://www.arameb.com/blog/2020/11/22/probability">"real"</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I feel like there's a tie between this and machine learning.</p>

      <p><b>Social Media Musings</b></p>

      <p>
        I think a more targeted analysis of what social media platforms
        <i>are</i> would be necessary for us to articulate what we intuitively
        feel like is wrong about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some dimensions of these platforms that make them suboptimal sources of
        meaningful knowledge:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><i>How we access the knowledge</i></p>
          <p>
            One interpretation of test-oriented learning is the
            <i>obstruction</i> of knowledge. You're not given the answers. This
            learning method bakes in habitual time investment as a condition to
            accessing information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bet is that this restriction will force students to study a
            wider breadth of knowledge (as opposed to the limited number of
            answers on the test key) and nudges them into spending more time
            wrestling with the material. For foundational knowledge domains that
            generalize well, it intuitively feels like this methodology fiats
            students that are well-trained in abstract reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that social media doesn't quite pair well with that
            knowledge acquisition formula. There's a pretty wide diversity of
            posts optimized for short-term engagement. It's difficult to develop
            any good abstractions given the user experienced presented by these
            platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i>What knowledge is shown on these platforms</i></p>
          <p>
            A normal person's normal thought will not help you in your abnormal
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people on these platforms won't offer you amazing advice on
            problems beyond a certain point of specificity. Particular problems
            require particular information with empiricial tests and intuition
            build up over long periods of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm thinking about a concept that I like to call the "inversion of
            the knowledge-experience hierarchy".
          </p>
          <p>
            We like in an age where kids are primarily consuming content made by
            other kids. You can say the same about teenagers and young adults.
            One possible side effect of this is the hollowing out of knowledge
            bases. We're not building on the paper trail of our forefathers;
            we're digging holes and then filling them in with short-term
            experiences. I'm curious (if not slightly worried) at where this
            will bring us in a few decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you might ask: what made the past different in this regard?
            Surely peers were learning from other peers back before social media
            existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll say that one compelling distinction is that previously
            information had to be accessed far more intentionally than today.
            Information was dispersed at a far lower throughput with true
            physical barriers to access (e.g. internet timeouts / newspapers
            still on paper) that restricted its availability enough to require
            conscious choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd be interested if there's any literature on whether we're
            approaching maximal information throughput in humans. It seems like
            an upper limit must exist (if nothing more than just the limitations
            to eyesight, hearing, reading).
          </p>
          <p>
            That is not to say that there is a limit to knowledge, which is a
            measure of information interpretation. An infinite number of
            interpretations may very well exist.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>So what can we do about it?</i></p>
      <p>
        Common objections to social media regulation that reduce to the
        inevitability of short-term human preference optimization are
        unpersuasive to me. Even though nicotine heavily spikes dopamine levels,
        we were able to phase out cigarettes with targeted public information
        campaigns (though it seems like vapes are making a comeback). I think we
        can begin to invest some thought into mirroring the most successful
        tactics in grassroots anti-drug movements for social media consumption
        (and we should obviously do away with
