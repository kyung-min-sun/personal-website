        Some of my unstructured thoughts. Not really questions or answers. Not
        refined enough to be blog posts. Just a lot of my open-ended ruminations
        and rants into the void.

        We rediscovered Fast Fourier Transform, not knowing that Gauss had
        invented it centuries prior.

      <p>How many great ideas were taken to the grave?</p>

        No one mentions that the emperor has no clothes because everyone thinks
        that they're an emperor without clothes.
      </p>
      <p>I hesitate to naturalize "just playing the game".</p>
      <p>
        For some reason, we enjoy the idea of our fictional characters
        outsmarting their opponents using a cocktail of deception and pure luck.

        The foundation of insecurity is the belief that you cannot trust
        yourself to decide what's true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The danger of rejecting universal truth is that it treats science as no
        different than religion. It anchors the value of truth to social
        cohesion.

      <p><b>On Statistical Determinism</b></p>
      <p>
        Inspired in part by "science vs. statistical generalization" question.
        How correct are the Malcolm Gladwell types? We know that there are
        significant statistical variations in economic indicators, population
        demographics, and socially acceptable cultural norms across history.
        Then, why is there an insistence on re-narrating history as an eternal
        gradient descent into a statistical equilibrium point for human society?
        Pop science books that venture into long, unfolding statistical
        explanations for key historical tipping points seem to all have this
        bizzare premise that "it was in the numbers from the beginning". I'm
        wondering how much of this is just pure hindsight bias -- or if
        historians are actually getting better at predicting future events by
        using Freakonomics school statistical analysis.

      <p><b>Code and Toilets</b></p>
      <p>
        I thought code was the toilet installation manual. We have installation
        manuals for toilets, and we have installation manuals for code. Code is
        the toilet.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes that sound so weird? Well, doesn’t code have “meaning”? We’ve
        appropriated a set of linguistic symbols for programming. If that’s the
        case, what’s the analog for toilets? If rudders and levers are not too
        different than variables and functions, then do they also have some
        symbolic meaning? We can all agree that machine code has little symbolic
        meaning, but we synthesize machine code to produce higher level
        languages — what are those in the context of programming?
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems like this analogy violates the intuitive boundary between
        mechanical functions and symbolic descriptions — because why stop at
        toilets? We can aggregate a set of ever-more complex mechanical systems
        all the way up to the level of ecosystems and entire bodies of physics.
        Are our laws of physics just meta-computer code? Do ecosystem functions
        have symbolic meaning? Is it that whenever we articulate an ecosystem’s
        mechanics that it becomes a program, or is it that the ecosystem itself
        is a program? Does a toilet “work” unless we’ve described its function?
      </p>

      <p>
        If we work the analogy further in the opposite direction, we start
        realizing that we’re not ever “building” software — we’re discovering
        it. If software operates as a mechanical system no different than the
        laws of physics, then it can never be “built”. No one “invented” the
        laws of physics, we merely observed them. We could say the same about
        software; we are unraveling the world into linguistic symbols that form
        a machine executable. Every software program is just a description.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s an interesting de-tour into object oriented (and functional)
        programming that this paradigm introduces. OOP comes from OOO — and
        while I’m not entirely familiar with OOO literature, my cursory
        understanding of that field points to the observation that we all exist
        as objects. We have identities and gain our existence through an object
        specification. Everything is an object, and we are just describing the
        behavior of objects whenever we write a program. We are just describing
        the behavior of objects whenever we create a toilet (e.g. which rudders
        are depressed when you flush; etc.).
      </p>

      <p>Not familiar enough with functional programming to comment.</p>

      <p>
        One interesting boundary problem that this produces: what’s the
        difference between nature and artifice? Knowing what we know now, we can
        make the assessment that nature becomes artifice when we articulate it.
        The laws of physics exist regardless of our interpretation of them, but
        once we’ve interpreted them into a system of physics they become a
        program and thus artifice.
      </p>

      <p>I’d love to get paid just to think about this.</p>
