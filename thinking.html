        Some of my unstructured thoughts. Not really questions or answers. Not
        refined enough to be blog posts. Just a lot of my open-ended ruminations
        and rants into the void.

      <p><b>Social Media Musings</b></p>

      <p>
        I think a more targeted analysis of what social media platforms
        <i>are</i> would be necessary for us to articulate what we intuitively
        feel like is wrong about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some dimensions of these platforms that make them suboptimal sources of
        meaningful knowledge:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><i>How we access the knowledge</i></p>
          <p>
            One interpretation of test-oriented learning is the
            <i>obstruction</i> of knowledge. You're not given the answers. This
            learning method bakes in habitual time investment as a condition to
            accessing information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bet is that this restriction will force students to study a
            wider breadth of knowledge (as opposed to the limited number of
            answers on the test key) and nudges them into spending more time
            wrestling with the material. For foundational knowledge domains that
            generalize well, it intuitively feels like this methodology fiats
            students that are well-trained in abstract reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that social media doesn't quite pair well with that
            knowledge acquisition formula. There's a pretty wide diversity of
            posts optimized for short-term engagement. It's difficult to develop
            any good abstractions given the user experienced presented by these
            platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i>What knowledge is shown on these platforms</i></p>
          <p>
            A normal person's normal thought will not help you in your abnormal
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people on these platforms won't offer you amazing advice on
            problems beyond a certain point of specificity. Particular problems
            require particular information with empiricial tests and intuition
            build up over long periods of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm thinking about a concept that I like to call the "inversion of
            the knowledge-experience hierarchy".
          </p>
          <p>
            We like in an age where kids are primarily consuming content made by
            other kids. You can say the same about teenagers and young adults.
            One possible side effect of this is the hollowing out of knowledge
            bases. We're not building on the paper trail of our forefathers;
            we're digging holes and then filling them in with short-term
            experiences. I'm curious (if not slightly worried) at where this
            will bring us in a few decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you might ask: what made the past different in this regard?
            Surely peers were learning from other peers back before social media
            existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll say that one compelling distinction is that previously
            information had to be accessed far more intentionally than today.
            Information was dispersed at a far lower throughput with true
            physical barriers to access (e.g. internet timeouts / newspapers
            still on paper) that restricted its availability enough to require
            conscious choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd be interested if there's any literature on whether we're
            approaching maximal information throughput in humans. It seems like
            an upper limit must exist (if nothing more than just the limitations
            to eyesight, hearing, reading).
          </p>
          <p>
            That is not to say that there is a limit to knowledge, which is a
            measure of information interpretation. An infinite number of
            interpretations may very well exist.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>So what can we do about it?</i></p>
      <p>
        Common objections to social media regulation that reduce to the
        inevitability of short-term human preference optimization are
        unpersuasive to me. Even though nicotine heavily spikes dopamine levels,
        we were able to phase out cigarettes with targeted public information
        campaigns (though it seems like vapes are making a comeback). I think we
        can begin to invest some thought into mirroring the most successful
        tactics in grassroots anti-drug movements for social media consumption
        (and we should obviously do away with tactics that clearly did not shift
        the needle).

      <p><b>Disembodiement</b></p>
      <p>
        Puzzled by how some people treat their video game avatars better than
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sort of life would we live if we saw our bodies as mere avatars?
      </p>
      <p>
        To what extent is this paradigm an essential part of self-improvement?

        No one mentions that the emperor has no clothes because everyone thinks
        that they're an emperor without clothes.

      <p>I hesitate to naturalize "just playing the game".</p>
      <p>
        For some reason, we enjoy the idea of our fictional characters
        outsmarting their opponents using a cocktail of deception and pure luck.

        The foundation of insecurity is the belief that you cannot trust
        yourself to decide what's true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The danger of rejecting universal truth is that it treats science as no
        different than religion. It anchors the value of truth to social
        cohesion.
      </p>

      <p><b>On Statistical Determinism</b></p>
      <p>
        Inspired in part by "science vs. statistical generalization" question.
        How correct are the Malcolm Gladwell types? We know that there are
        significant statistical variations in economic indicators, population
        demographics, and socially acceptable cultural norms across history.
        Then, why is there an insistence on re-narrating history as an eternal
        gradient descent into a statistical equilibrium point for human society?
        Pop science books that venture into long, unfolding statistical
        explanations for key historical tipping points seem to all have this
        bizzare premise that "it was in the numbers from the beginning". I'm
        wondering how much of this is just pure hindsight bias -- or if
        historians are actually getting better at predicting future events by
        using Freakonomics school statistical analysis.

      <p><b>Code and Toilets</b></p>
      <p>
        I thought code was the toilet installation manual. We have installation
        manuals for toilets, and we have installation manuals for code. Code is
        the toilet.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes that sound so weird? Well, doesn’t code have “meaning”? We’ve
        appropriated a set of linguistic symbols for programming. If that’s the
        case, what’s the analog for toilets? If rudders and levers are not too
        different than variables and functions, then do they also have some
        symbolic meaning? We can all agree that machine code has little symbolic
        meaning, but we synthesize machine code to produce higher level
        languages — what are those in the context of programming?
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems like this analogy violates the intuitive boundary between
        mechanical functions and symbolic descriptions — because why stop at
        toilets? We can aggregate a set of ever-more complex mechanical systems
        all the way up to the level of ecosystems and entire bodies of physics.
        Are our laws of physics just meta-computer code? Do ecosystem functions
        have symbolic meaning? Is it that whenever we articulate an ecosystem’s
        mechanics that it becomes a program, or is it that the ecosystem itself
        is a program? Does a toilet “work” unless we’ve described its function?
      </p>

      <p>
        If we work the analogy further in the opposite direction, we start
        realizing that we’re not ever “building” software — we’re discovering
        it. If software operates as a mechanical system no different than the
        laws of physics, then it can never be “built”. No one “invented” the
        laws of physics, we merely observed them. We could say the same about
        software; we are unraveling the world into linguistic symbols that form
        a machine executable. Every software program is just a description.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s an interesting de-tour into object oriented (and functional)
        programming that this paradigm introduces. OOP comes from OOO — and
        while I’m not entirely familiar with OOO literature, my cursory
        understanding of that field points to the observation that we all exist
        as objects. We have identities and gain our existence through an object
        specification. Everything is an object, and we are just describing the
        behavior of objects whenever we write a program. We are just describing
        the behavior of objects whenever we create a toilet (e.g. which rudders
        are depressed when you flush; etc.).
      </p>

      <p>Not familiar enough with functional programming to comment.</p>

      <p>
        One interesting boundary problem that this produces: what’s the
        difference between nature and artifice? Knowing what we know now, we can
        make the assessment that nature becomes artifice when we articulate it.
        The laws of physics exist regardless of our interpretation of them, but
        once we’ve interpreted them into a system of physics they become a
        program and thus artifice.
      </p>

      <p>I’d love to get paid just to think about this.</p>
