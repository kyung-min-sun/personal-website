        <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Kevin—founder, engineer, and writer.</p>
        <p>
          Recently, I was the CTO and co-founder of
          <a href="https://goodhome.health" target="_blank">Goodhome</a>—where I
          built the website, engineered
          <a href="https://goodhome.health/report-card">
            America's most comprehensive home health report card</a
          >, and developed our research-backed protocol for home health
          checkups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was the sole founding engineer at
          <a href="https://accordingly.co" target="_blank">Accordingly</a>—where
          I built core SaaS for enterprise IT procurement and scaled the company
          from $0 to $1M ARR.
        </p>
        <p>
          In college, I was a
          <a href="https://today.usc.edu/usc-trojan-debate-squad-win/">
            nationally competitive debater</a
          >, built an
          <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/leavey-labs-inc/id1631422938"
            >app studio</a
          >, and conducted AI research in the
          <a href="https://huanglab.usc.edu/group-members/">Huang Lab</a>. I won
          USC's first national debate championship since possibly the Vietnam
          War, acquired
          <a
            href="https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2022/09/21/spread-love-find-love-usc-exclusive-dating-app-aims-to-reunite-mist-connections/"
            >10K+ downloads</a
          >
          for a consumer social app, and developed stochastic methods to reduce
          deformities in 3D printing.

          On your left, I've included an evolving assortment of my questions,
          answers, and unstructured thoughts. Feel free to probe my mind—I hope
          my words can spark interesting conversations.

          everything in between.
